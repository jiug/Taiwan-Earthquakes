# [WIP] Study of earquakes in Taiwan (2013-2023)

## To do 

- [x] Hypothesis Testing, could the drift be due to chance?
- [x] Separate the two earthquake populations in different datasets
- [ ] Organize thought flow
- [ ] Train a model that is able to discern between the two earthquake populations



## Findings

- There are two distinct distributions of earthquakes. 
- The drift is statistically significant
- Gutenber-Richter parameters
